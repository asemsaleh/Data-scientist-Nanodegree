# Exploring Stackoverflow Survey 2017
###Project Motivation

In this project I was intrested to analyze stackoverflow survey in order to apply the  "Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)" process.
Data is shared for everyone and can be accessed from :
[Stackoverflow Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)

I used Stack Overflow data from 2017 to answer the following questions:

* Is there an equality  of salary and working hours across males and females?
* Which programming language has the highest job satisfaction?
* Where is the most countries that developers working from home?

Results
*Females and males are almost equal from salary and working hours side.
*The highest programming languages are SQL,Javascript,Python and the lowest are Rust,Visual Basic and TypeScrpit
*Work from home is more popular for developers in these countries: Iran, Pakistan.
